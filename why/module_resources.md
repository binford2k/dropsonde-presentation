.callout.warning Every single platform or feature you support takes time to maintain it!

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* To make the most effective use of our time, we should focus on the most used code
* If people aren't using a class, then dedicating maintenance time to it is wasted
* Especially if that code adds complications
    * fragile testing
    * more choices lead to complex user experience
    * unneccesary abstractions make code harder to read
    * I have an old Drupal module myself that includes sub-classes based on a
      complex case statement and string interpolation and why?
* I remember reading an article once that explains how your business should "fire"
  customers that cost you more to keep than they actually generated.
* Likewise, sometimes we need to "fire" code that's not worth keeping.
* But how do we know? How do we make these decisions?
