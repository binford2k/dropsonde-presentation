~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* With all due respect to Robert Frost; as developers, we generally want to take the road ***MOST*** traveled!
* Just like seeing the wear patterns in these roads, knowing the usage patterns
  of our code is how we know what code to focus on.
* Or even what code to dump.
* Saas applications are used to easy access to profiling metrics because most
  platforms have endpoint tracing built in.
* Twitter *always* knows what parts of their platform are used most consistently.
* For on-prem software like Puppet modules though, we have to gather those patterns in other ways.
