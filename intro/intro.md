* Hi, I'm Ben, aka binford2k on the interwebs.
* I push the bits and talk to the peoples at Puppet and in our community.
* If you hang out in our Slack, you've probably seen me grouch that not knowing
  how people use Puppet holds us back from improvements.
* So in keeping with tradition, I'll be doing that again today
* But this time I hope to have a solution.
