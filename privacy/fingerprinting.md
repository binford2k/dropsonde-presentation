# Fingerprinting

![fingerprint](/_images/fingerprint.png)

* A more insidious danger is _fingerprinting_.
* Identifying individuals by properties or habits.
* Also applies to infrastructures.

.callout.fingerprint If you saw that a site was in the `CEST` time zone, had
the locale set to `fr-ch`, and had thousands of nodes classified with various
HPC modules, then you might guess that you were looking at CERN.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

For example, if you saw that a site was:

* in the `CEST` time zone (central european summer time)
* had the locale set to `fr-ch` (swiss-french)
* had tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes classified with various HPC modules

then you might surmise that you were looking at CERN and use the rest of that
record as reconnaissance against them!
