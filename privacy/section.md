# Privacy. It's a thing.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* But that immediately raises the privacy red flag.
* Any time a tool I use phones home, I immediately wonder what it's gathering.
* Whether it's sneaking information that I don't really want to share.
* I run Little Snitch, just like many of you, and I often even bust out Wireshark.
* So privacy and maintaining trust was the first thing on my mind.
